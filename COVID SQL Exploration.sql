/*
This project looks at two covid datasets up to the 12th April 2022.
One dataset looks at cases and deaths and one looks at vaccinations.
Below we investigate this dataset using SQL.

Skills Used: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types
